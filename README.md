Geely Auto, an automobile company, wants to set up its production unit in the US to compete with its counterparts here. 
First, it hired a consulting company to prepare a database of its competitors' vehicles on the market, including their features and prices.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
How well those variables describe the price of a car
We will model car prices with the available independent variables, and this model will be used by management to understand exactly how prices vary with the independent variables.
